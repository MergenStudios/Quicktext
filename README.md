# Quicktext

I often find myself in the situation that I want to quickly type something to copy it out, without obstructing the view on whatever I'm looking at (e.g a picture or a paused video). This is what quicktext is for, a realy realy simple window with nothing but a text field. Use it however you want, but I recommend binding the application to a system wide hotkey for easier acess
